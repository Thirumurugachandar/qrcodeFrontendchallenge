## My process

- built html tags
- built css for the html tags
- compared with design image provided by checking whether each of the html tags have correct styling or not.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

body{
background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
min-height: 100vh;
display: flex;
justify-content: center;
align-items: center;
font-family: 'Outfit', sans-serif;
}

the min-height css property in the above body section helps me to center the div correctly.Without min-height property, i am struggling to center the div with just flex properties. This is the major learning for me in this coding challenge.

### Continued development

I want to improve in getting the screen sizes and font sizes right and i will work on it.

### Useful resources

- (Frontend Zone) youtube channel really helped me in using simple and few lines of code to complete this challenge.
